# SciLitMiner
A Scientific Literature Mining Platform for Materials Science and Beyond

This platform aims to assist researchers, especially those in the materials science field, in accelerating data-driven materials discovery and design through literature mining. The platform facilitates the automatic ingestion of scientific literature, followed by the identification of relevant publications containing scientific datasets embedded within visual elements.

The platform's codebases can be found at:
https://github.com/vipulg13/scilitminer-frontend.git
https://github.com/vipulg13/scilitminer-backend-sync.git
https://github.com/vipulg13/scilitminer-backend-async.git

Note: Since there are dependencies on open-source softwares, such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and Monstache, instructions for setting up the sandbox environment with Docker and Kubernetes will be added.
